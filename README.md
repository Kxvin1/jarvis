## J.A.R.V.I.S. -- Inspired by Iron Man's AI assistant from the movies

- Why this project? I've always wanted to create something that could execute everyday tasks as well as automate things for me just by typing commands, so I went with a Discord bot!

## Planned Features

- I have a lot of fun working on this and it's definitely still a work in progress. I'm constantly thinking of new features to add to it, the next ones I plan to implement are Twitter API and Reddit API. 
- In addition I'm thinking of adding more features such as getting the latest news from a certain news website, retrieving a word's definition or synonyms, creating a note, storing images, and getting traffic details for a trip.

- I plan to replace Uptime Robot with Amazon EC2 and for when I implement notes/images I will be giving J.A.R.V.I.S. a database, likely a NoSQL database like Amazon DynamoDB.

## Here are some key features that are fully functional:

- Leveraged Replit and Uptime Robot in order to keep the Discord bot running and available 24/7
- Designed to respond to specific chat commands and performs actions or API calls based on those chat messages
- Utilized a Geolocation API to locate a user’s geographical location details when provided an IP address
- Used a Weather API to get a city’s weather forecast, accepts multiple commands such as zip code or city name
- Introduced Google Calendar API to allow bot to add events to my personal Google Calendar through a command
