## J.A.R.V.I.S. -- Inspired by Iron Man's AI assistant from the movies

- Why this project? I've always wanted to create something that could execute everyday tasks as well as automate things for me just by typing commands, so I went with a Discord bot.
- I have a lot of fun working on this and it's definitely still a work in progress.



## Planned Features

- Reddit - get links/content from specified subreddit, get top comments of a post
- Spotify - use Spotify
- Twitter - get a specified user's recent tweets, post a tweet on personal account)
- Dictionary - get details for a specific word (definition, synonym, used in a sentence, etc)
- UrbanDictionary - same as dictionary but uses UrbanDictionary
- Similar Music/Movies/TV Shows - recommends similar media forms based on specified query and media type
- Password Generator - generate a randomly generated password of specified length and types of characters to include (nums, chars, caps)
- Google Translator - translate a word or phrase into requested language
- News - gets the most recent news articles for the day
- Nutrition - gets nutrition information of a specified food/dish/meal
- Replace Uptime Robot with Amazon EC2
- Give Jarvis a database - DynamoDB
- Twitter + Notion - Save a specified tweet to Notion


## Here are some key features that are fully functional:

- Leveraged Replit and Uptime Robot in order to keep the Discord bot running and available 24/7
- Designed to respond to specific chat commands and performs actions or API calls based on those chat messages
- Utilized a Geolocation API to locate a user’s geographical location details when provided an IP address
- Used a Weather API to get a city’s weather forecast, accepts multiple commands such as zip code or city name
- Introduced Google Calendar API to allow bot to add events to my personal Google Calendar through a command
